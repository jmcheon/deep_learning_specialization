# Course1 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning

In course 1, we focus on how to implement a neural network from scratch in python code to understand the underlying basic notions of two separate forward and backward propagation to learn a neural network a useful decision boundary for binary classification tasks by varying the number of hidden layers etc.
